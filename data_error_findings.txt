Data Error and complications Findings 

1) Same players have multiple entries with different values
	for eg: player_api_id 660145 has 3 entries with different overall ratings, crossing etc
	update: might be because attributes change every season, keeping the first entry only for the time being,
	might chnage it later
2) Player names and attributes are in two different tables, so I joined both tables and made one dataframe from
	sql join.
3) Both players table and match table have date. So, need to use attributes of players corresponding the date
